With Space, you can fix that one missing app. 

### Purpose

In a world with the Launchpad containing a ```7x5``` grid of applications, it hurts to see one app missing when you have ```34 apps```

What do you do? Do you make folders? Do you delete an app? Do you download a new app?

## No.

What app goes in that ```35th``` slot?

```Space``` is that app.
